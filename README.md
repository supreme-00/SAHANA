This repository contains the code and workflow for Sahana, a small transformer-based classifier designed to detect emotional tension, extreme stress, and crisis-risk signals in Hinglish text.

The project focuses on responsible NLP for student well-being, with emphasis on:

1. low-resource code-mixed data,

2. emotion classification,

3. preliminary crisis-risk indicators,

4. and a human-in-the-loop escalation design.

The full implementation (training pipeline, preprocessing, evaluation, and demo) will be pushed within 24 hours.

Stay tuned.
